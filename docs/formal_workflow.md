## üåü Step-by-Step Workflow Setup

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Create a Team Repository**

* One team member creates a **new repository** on GitHub.
* Add other teammates as **Collaborators** under **Settings > Collaborators & teams**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Clone the Repository**

* Each member clones the repo to their local machine:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Branching Workflow**

* For each new feature or task, create a **new branch**:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/<your-feature-name>
```

* Work on the task, then **commit changes regularly**.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Push Branch to GitHub**

```bash
git push -u origin feature/<your-feature-name>
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Create a Pull Request (PR)**

* Go to the GitHub repo page.
* Click **"Compare & Pull Request"**.
* Add a **meaningful title** and **description** of the changes.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Request Review**

* In the PR page, **assign a reviewer** (teammate).
* The reviewer checks for code quality, logic, and consistency.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Approve & Merge**

* Reviewer approves by clicking **"Approve"**.
* Once approved, **merge** the PR into the `main` branch.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ **Pull Changes Locally**

* After PRs are merged, everyone **pulls latest changes**:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ **Use GitHub Project Boards**

* Go to the repo's **Projects** tab.
* Create a **Project Board** (Kanban style) with columns like:

  * **To Do**
  * **In Progress**
  * **Done**
* Add tasks as **issues** and assign them to teammates.
* Move issues across columns as tasks progress.
