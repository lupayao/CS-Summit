### Pre-Configured Repository for Merge Conflict Practice

This repository is designed to simulate real-world merge conflicts. It includes two branches (`main` and `feature`) with intentionally conflicting changes in a shared file. Students can clone this repo, follow the steps, and practice resolving conflicts.
