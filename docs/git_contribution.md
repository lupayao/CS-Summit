### Rubric for Evaluating Student Contributions to Group Projects Using Git

| **Criteria**                  | **Excellent (4)**                                                                                                  | **Proficient (3)**                                                                            | **Developing (2)**                                                                         | **Beginning (1)**                                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Commit Quality**            | Clear, descriptive, and concise commit messages; logical commit history; atomic commits for small, related changes | Mostly clear messages; some logical grouping; occasional large or vague commits               | Vague or generic messages (e.g., "fixed bug"); commits lack clarity; inconsistent grouping | Messages are unclear or absent; commits made without explanation or logic     |
| **Branch Management**         | Regular use of feature branches; proper merging; resolves conflicts independently                                  | Uses feature branches occasionally; basic merging; needs help resolving conflicts             | Rare use of branches; often works on `main`; struggles with merging                        | No branch usage; commits directly to `main` only                              |
| **Collaboration**             | Actively collaborates; regularly pulls, pushes, and merges; resolves conflicts constructively                      | Participates in collaboration; some pulling/pushing; relies on others for conflict resolution | Limited participation; infrequent pulls/pushes; rarely resolves conflicts                  | Does not collaborate; works in isolation; no pulls/pushes or team interaction |
| **Frequency of Commits**      | Commits regularly throughout the project; reflects continuous progress                                             | Commits at key milestones; some gaps in progress                                              | Few commits; long gaps between updates                                                     | Single or very few commits; little evidence of progress                       |
| **Code Contribution Quality** | High-quality, well-documented code; follows style guide; improves codebase                                         | Good quality; mostly follows standards; occasional improvements                               | Basic code contributions; limited attention to documentation or style                      | Minimal or no code contributions; poor quality or irrelevant changes          |

**Note:** This rubric can be adapted based on project scope and student experience level.
